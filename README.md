# 🎵 Music Transformer: Generating Music with Long-Term Structure

This repository is a reimplementation of the research paper:  
📄 [Music Transformer: Generating Music with Long-Term Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281) by Huang et al., 2018.

> This model leverages the Transformer architecture with a novel **relative positional encoding** mechanism to generate coherent and structured musical sequences over long time spans.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Transformer-based architecture optimized for music generation.
- Support for **relative positional self-attention** for capturing long-term dependencies.
- Trained on MIDI-based datasets (e.g., MAESTRO, JSB Chorales).
- Support for both training and inference.
- Generates symbolic music in MIDI format.

---

## 🧠 Paper Contributions Summary

- Proposed a **relative attention mechanism** to overcome limitations of absolute position encodings for musical data.
- Demonstrated the model's capability to generate longer and more musically coherent sequences than baseline models.
- Introduced **event-based representation** of MIDI music for efficient tokenization.

## Week 1
*Reading the paper completely will be the main goal , completely understanding what i need to implement before getting to coding 
*Gathering datasets would be the next task and I'd proceed to data preprocessing after that
