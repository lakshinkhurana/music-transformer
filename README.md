# 🎵 Music Transformer: Generating Music with Long-Term Structure

This repository is a reimplementation of the research paper:  
📄 [Music Transformer: Generating Music with Long-Term Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281) by Huang et al., 2018.

> This model leverages the Transformer architecture with a novel **relative positional encoding** mechanism to generate coherent and structured musical sequences over long time spans.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Transformer-based architecture optimized for music generation.
- Support for **relative positional self-attention** for capturing long-term dependencies.
- Trained on MIDI-based datasets (e.g., MAESTRO, JSB Chorales).
- Support for both training and inference.
- Generates symbolic music in MIDI format.

---

## 🧠 Paper Contributions Summary

- Proposed a **relative attention mechanism** to overcome limitations of absolute position encodings for musical data.
- Demonstrated the model's capability to generate longer and more musically coherent sequences than baseline models.
- Introduced **event-based representation** of MIDI music for efficient tokenization.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-transformer.git
cd music-transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Main dependencies:**

* `torch`
* `pretty_midi`
* `numpy`
* `tqdm`
* `pytorch-lightning` *(optional)*

---

## 🎼 Dataset

Use any of the following datasets (preprocessed into tokenized sequences):

* [MAESTRO Dataset (by Google)](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro)
* [JSB Chorales Dataset](https://github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset)

To preprocess MIDI files:

```bash
python utils/midi_utils.py --input_dir data/midi --output_file data/encoded_data.pkl
```

---

## 🏋️ Training

Edit `configs/config.yaml` to set hyperparameters and paths.

Then run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml
```

---

## 🎧 Generation

To generate a MIDI file from a trained model:

```bash
python generate.py --checkpoint_path checkpoints/best_model.pth --output_dir generated/
```

This will generate a `.mid` file you can play using any MIDI player or DAW.

| Transformer (Baseline) | 1.78         | Medium      |                              |
| **Music Transformer**  | **1.63**     | **High**    | Achieves long-term structure |

Sample generations available in the `generated/` directory.
